    "### Limitations:\n",
    "* For simple models, RL can be overkill and a waste of time; models with hyperparameter tuning are already powerful\n",
    "* Assumed enviroment is Markovian; future states are based on current enviroment, cant account for random things happening when its deployed\n",
    "* Can take very long time to train\n",
    "* Can sometimes be not stable; model might start exploiting enviroment, and cap the rewards before truly fully exploring; mitigated with hyperparameters "
